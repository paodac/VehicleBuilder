# 08 TypeScript and OOP: Vehicle Builder

### User Story

```md
AS a developer
I WANT to update an existing application to include additional vehicle types
SO THAT I am able to comprehend and work with existing code bases.
```
## Description

>
> An application to build and use different vehicles.
> For this program the user will be able to create a new vehicle, let it be a motorbike, a car, or a truck. He will be able to submit information about said vehicle and later on be able to do different actions with it, such as start it, accelerate, turn to the sides, etc. He will also be able to use previously saved vehicles to perform the actions with.
>The user will use the npm start command and follow the questions being asked by the inquirer.
